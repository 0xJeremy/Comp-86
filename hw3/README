The Main.java file contains the main method for this program. It creates a 
Frame which is extended in frame.java. The frame has a canvas (Canvas.java), 
and buttons of various kinds (both default JButtons and ActionButton.java). 
Additionally it has ActionCheckBox.java and some additional widgets.

When the "Toggle Display" button is pressed initially, a oval is drawn in the 
display. Subsequent presses cause the oval to move in front or behind the 
display. This is a mechanic that will be used in the final project.

The concentric circles shown are a work in progress for a "radar" system that 
will also be used in the final project.

The structure of this program is roughly:
	- Main.java
		- frame.java
			- Canvas.java
			- ActionButton.java
			- ActionCheckbox.java

The button callback from the main function is used in the canvas to repaint, 
and is wrapped by the frame object.
