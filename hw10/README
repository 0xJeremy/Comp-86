***********************************************/

This homework was completed fully to the specification. A custom object was
created to simulate an enemy "base" as it might appear on a radar. Two V shaped
formations of planes and boats were also created as they might appear on a
radar. Information at the top gives the user information as to how they
might manipulate the simulation. The user is able to move the formation
of blocks manually using wasd, and can create new cubes and sphers. The base
is fixed and the user is unable to interact with it.

Global variables in this program were limited to those required to keep the
scene updated. Several counter variables were created to help keep track of the
number and location of different objects. Keyboard controls were implemented
so as to listen in real time.

The only object to inheret from another is the "tower" object which inherits
from THREE.Object3D. The rest of the objects were made to be similar to how
they appeared in the orignal homeworks, and therefore did not require custom
shapes.
