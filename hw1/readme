# Homework 1
The code from this assignment creates a basic user interface 
with several different types of buttons, checkboxes, and 
dropdown menus. The buttons in the first column are static, 
and print out what is displayed on them to the console. The 
second column is a series of checkboxes that do the same 
when pressed. The third column is comprised of dropdown 
menus that display on console when a new selection has been 
made. The fourth and final column changes what is displayed 
on the button when pressed, and prints out what is currently 
displayed when the button was pressed.

To compile the program, use
	javac Main.java frame.java ActionButton.java ActionCheckBox.java ActionComboBox.java ActionSwitchButton.java QuitButton.java
To run the program, use
	java Main
