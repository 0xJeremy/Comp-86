This GUI will be an interface similar to what may be seen on a 
control panel of a navy ship patrolling for other ships. It will 
contain a main draw area with a radar scanning for objects, and will 
be surrounded by buttons and sliders. A slider will be used to zoom 
and scale the radar. The buttons will illuminate different types of 
objects surrounding the ship, while checkboxes turn on and off 
various features of the scanner.
