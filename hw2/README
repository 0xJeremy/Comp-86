The file Main.java contains the main function for this program. The 
frame.java file handles the actual JFrame object, but allows for the 
main to add things to it. Canvas.java handles the drawing board of 
the program, while ActionCheckBox.java and ActionButton.java are 
extensions of the JButton and JCheckBox, with some slight 
modification that will make it easier to expand the program in the 
future.

To be more explicit: frame.java extends the JFrame class. 
ActionCheckBox extends the default JCheckBox but adds wrapper 
functions that make it easier for the user to print to console. 
ActionButton extends the default JButton but adds wrapper functions 
that make it easier for the user to print to console.
The main function in Main.java creates and instanciates frame.java 
and then adds various components to it.

To compile this program, use:
	javac Main.java frame.java Canvas.java ActionCheckBox.java 
	ActionButton.java

To run this program, use:
	java Main
