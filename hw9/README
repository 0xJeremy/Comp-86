Assignment 9 will be completed by Jeremy Kanovsky and Ryan Sheehan.

We will be making a staring contest judge. To do this, we will make use of the 
webcam is users laptop and use image recognition javascript frameworks to 
detect the two users faces and determine when they blink. Specifically, we 
will use Webgazer.js, tracking.js, and the Google Voice API. The google voice 
api will be used to enable voice controls on our website.

Examples of some of the code we will use in our project can be found at 
https://github.com/0xJeremy/Comp-86-Final-Project
This is a low level test of the frameworks and APIs that will be implemented 
into our project.

The use of the interfaces will be fairly straighforward. We will use 
tracking.js to identify the two heads of the users, and then create two 
instances of the Webgazer.js framework to identify two sets of eyes. We will 
continue to track these heads/eyes until one player blinks at which point we 
will inform the users as to the winner of the staring contest. New games can 
be started by voice controls so both players can continue to stare at the 
screen without looking down at the mouse while playing.
